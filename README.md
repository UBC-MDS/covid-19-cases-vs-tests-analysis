# Covid-19 Cases vs Tests Analysis

-   Authors: Fatime Selimi, Neel Phaterpekar, Nicholas Wu, Tanmay Sharma

## About

The data set used in this project comes from the Our World in Data
COVID-19 Database created by Hannah Richie et al. (Max Roser and Hasell
2020). This data set examines the impact of COVID-19 on countries all
over the world, where daily statistics pertaining to the pandemic from
over 200 countries have been recorded each day since December 31st 2019.
Each row in the data set represents a date in a country, where
measurements like total cases, new daily cases, hospital admission rates
etc. are recorded. Data has been collected in conjunction with the World
Health Organization (WHO), the European Center for Disease Prevention
and Control (ECDC) and is available on [Our World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and raw data can be found
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv).

With this data, we ask whether there is a difference in the ratio of the 
new daily tests performed to the new daily cases between Canada and the 
United States. Since the distributions were found to be left skewed and 
of unequal variance, we performed a two-tailed hypothesis test checking for 
the independence of medians using permutation. With a significance level of 
0.05, we found that there was enough evidence to conclude that the median 
response ratio was significantly different between Canada and the United States 
(p-value < 0.0001). This is one way to begin to assess the different responses
and outcomes that these two countries have faced during the pandemic. However, 
further analysis is required to better understand the differences present in
the Canada-US responses to COVID-19.
