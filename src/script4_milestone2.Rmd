## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
covid_all_country <-  read_csv("../data/owid-covid-data.csv", guess_max = 5000)
covid_CAN_USA <- covid_all_country %>% 
    filter(iso_code=="CAN"| iso_code =="USA") %>% 
    filter(date < "2020-11-01") %>% 
    filter(new_cases != 0 & new_tests !=0) %>% 
    select("iso_code", "date", "location", "new_tests", "new_cases") %>% 
    drop_na(new_tests, new_cases) %>% 
    mutate(response_ratio = new_tests/new_cases) %>% 
    mutate(log_response_ratio = log10(response_ratio),
           inverse_ratio = 1/response_ratio)
covid_CAN_USA
```



```{r}
can_data <- covid_CAN_USA %>% 
  filter(iso_code == 'CAN')

us_data <- covid_CAN_USA %>%
  filter(iso_code == 'USA') %>% 
  drop_na()

```

```{r}
shapiro.test(can_data$inverse_ratio)
```





```{r}

            mu = mean(response_ratio),
            sd = sd (response_ratio),
            se = sd / (sqrt(n))
  )

```{r}

1.  $H_0$: The mean response ratio in Canada is equal to the mean response ratio in the United States

    $H_a$: The mean response ratio in Canada is **not** equal to the mean response ratio in the United States


```{r}

welch_test <- t.test( response_ratio ~ location, data = covid_CAN_USA)
tidy(welch_test)

```


```{r}
wilcox_test <- wilcox.test(response_ratio ~ location, data=covid_CAN_USA)
wilcox_test %>% tidy()

```
